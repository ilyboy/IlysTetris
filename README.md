# IlysTetris
My version of modern Tetris

Because nobody does this, here's my version of modern Tetris!
Complete with Holding, 7-Bag Randomizer, Harddrop, T-Spins, SRS, Stalling and a few smaller features.
Press left, right and down to move the piece
Press A and F to rotate
Press S to Hold
Press D to Harddrop
Complete rows to clear them
Try scoring as many points as possible(T-Spins, Perfect Clears, Combos, more rows at once and a higher level grant more points)
If a piece is unable to spawn, the game ends.
Have Fun!
